# create-dps-batch-file

This script allows you to easily create a batch file for use with the DPS (Department of Public Safety) by providing an Excel file as input. The Excel file should contain all of the necessary information required by DPS in order to process the batch file.

Once the script has been run, it will output a text file that is ready to be uploaded to DPS. The text file will be formatted according to the specifications required by DPS for batch files.

To use the script, simply provide the path to the Excel file as an argument when running the script. The script will handle the rest, creating the batch file and saving it.
